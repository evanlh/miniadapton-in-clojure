# Installation

## Pre-requisites
Install [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) and make sure you have your editor setup for [interactive REPL support](https://clojure.org/guides/editors).

## Running the notebook
1. Open [main.clj](./main.clj) in your REPL-enabled editor.
2. Start a REPL. (In Emacs this is `M-x cider-jack-in`)
3. Interactively execute the `(clerk/serve!)` and `(clerk/show!)` lines
4. Go to http://localhost:7777
